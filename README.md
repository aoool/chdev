**Linux character device driver**. The driver allows you to work with the fixed size circular buffer. **chdev** stores items which, for example, could be strings or any other sort of information presented as a sequence of bytes. Despite the fact that the driver was written for educational purposes, many useful aspects of Linux device drivers programming were touched:
